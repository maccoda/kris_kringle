# Kris Kringle
Just a little terminal application to easily organize Christmas Kris Kringles. Make sure you have everyone together to get this done. The results will be written to a file, one file for each Kris Kringle. The file is the givers name, that is if the file `Bob.kk` contains `Alice` then Bob is getting a gift for Alice.

### Note
* This is by no means the best secretive method so just need to trust everyone else
* This is randomly generated so each run will result in a different pairing. Can use the generated files so will only need to run once.

## Run
This project is built with cargo and can be run with `cargo run --bin main -- <conf-file>`
