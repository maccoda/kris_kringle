# Kris Kringle
Just a little terminal application to easily organize Christmas Kris Kringles. Make sure you have everyone together to get this done.

### Note
* This is by no means the best secretive method so just need to trust everyone else
* This is randomly generated so each run will result in a different pairing

## Run
This project is built with cargo and can be run with `cargo run`

That is all you need. The application will run you through the steps. It is also running on an infinite loop just incase someone needed to check their list twice so just end it with `ctrl + c`, I know not the prettiest but will do for now.
